                    <h3>How do I store my cupcakes?</h3>
                    <p>If you are planning on eating them within a day you can store them at room temperature. If you are not going to eat them right away you can freeze them. To thaw them, take them out of the freezer and cover them lightly with plastic wrap while they thaw. This will minimize condensation forming on the cupcakes. They should be ready to eat in about an hour. You should not refrigerate your cupcakes overnight because they will dry out.</p>
